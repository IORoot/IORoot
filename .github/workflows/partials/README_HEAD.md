For the more tech-side of things and random stuff, my personal blog is over at [IORoot.com](https://ioroot.com/).

I generally end up doing more development projects for LondonParkour, but they'll mostly revolve around the following things:

- PHP / SASS / WordPress & Plugin development.
- Cameras / GoPros / DSLRs / Filming and building cool rigs for parkour filming.
- Tinkering with various technologies and scripts from `ffmpeg` to `SVGs`.
- Design work with Sketch and Photoshop.
- Video editing, Videography and After Effects.

Basically, I have a passion for playing with any technology that will get me to accomplish my goal.
